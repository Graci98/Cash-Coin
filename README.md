# Coinbase Global Inc.

## Origins of Coinbase 

*Coinbase Global Inc. was founded on May 14, 2012 by a former airbnb engineer brian armstrong. This idea came about after Brian had gone to live in Buenos Aires,Argentina and was deeply disturbed by the dysfunctional monetary system of the country and according to him he saw that the people didn't believe that the future could be better. One day during Christmas he stumbled upon an article about Bitcoin that led him to think about the economy in a global sense. "Many countries around the world don't have stable financial systems. I really believe in the potential of Bitcoin to create empowerment for people but it needs to be dramatically easier to use and trusted and safe", said Armstrong. At the time the only means of buying Bitcoin was Mt.GOX which was unsafe and not an easy means. After a failed attempt at presenting his idea to Y Combinator Brian Armostrong realized there was a need for a co-founder. Co-Founder Fred Ersham became obsessed with Bitcoin and later quit his job as a trader at Goldman Sachs to join Brian Armstrong to build what is now today Coinbase. Coinbase was funded by both the co-founders working capital but throughout the years Coinbase has received a total of $30 billion in venture funding.*

## Business Activities 

*Coinbase allows consumers the ability to buy and sell crypto with ease. Being able to send and receive crypto between online balances, friends, or merchants free of charge. Furthermore, coinbase handles the security and backups to allow a smooth process for the user. The customers for coinbase range between 3 primary lines of business which are individuals, businesses, and developers. Unlike its competitors, Coinbase does not act as a "market maker" meaning they do not operate a proprietary trading business. In an article written to counteract Wall Street Journal claims about coinbase being client-driven activities it is said, "one of the competitive strengths of our Institutional Prime is our agency only trading model, where we act only on behalf of our clients".* 

## Landscape 

*Coinbase Global is a company within the Blockchain industry. As a result of its multiple benefits, blockchain is seen as a vital component of the upcoming technological revolution. Its uses have surpassed cryptocurrencies and are now seen in healthcare, e-commerce, publishing, banking and various industries. According to an article written by the founder of SOFTERMII "the emergence of green initiatives, the growing popularity of Non-Fungible Tokens, and the development of the Metaverse are among the biggest blockchain trends for 2023". Major companies that can be found within Blockchain not only stop at Coinbase but a few are Canaan Inc., Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd, Riot Blockchain Inc., Silvergate Capital Corporation, and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc.*

## Results

*Coinbase has left a footprint within the business world. It has opened doors for everyday users to navigate the technical world and invest in cryptocurrency straightforwardly, therefore increasing user growth,trade volume and security and trust within the blockchain industry. Core metrics that companies in Blockchain use to measure success are Transactions Per Second: used to identify the scalability requirements of a blockchain and the volume of data it can process. Transaction Latency: the amount of time that passes between a particular transaction being submitted to a blockchain and it being approved or rejected. Transaction Throughput: the time required for valid records to be added to blocks. Energy Efficiency: A blockchain requires a certain amount of energy to function this considers the scarcity of energy across the globe and how to save it. Number of Validators: those who verify transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. Block Time: The amount of time required by validators or miners to verify the transactions stored in a block, and once complete create another one.*

## Recommendations 

*A service that I would suggest Coinbase to offer would be a Crypto Savings Account and in these accounts they could offer interest bearing options creating an alternative avenue for users to earn passive income on their crypto holdings overtime. This would benefit the company because it would draw an even bigger market for coinbase because consumers would be able to diversify their financial portfolio and now be able to include coinbase as a place to invest long term increasing revenue within coinbase. This service would potentially utilize more blockchain and smart contracts to implement these accounts in a secure manner.*
